# Algorithms

This repo contains codes for basic algorithms such as binary search, Fibonnaci Numbers and their properties, Divide & Conquer Algorithms (Quick Sort, MergeSort, etc.) and Dynamic Programming.

All codes are in Python and the questions are taken from the Algorithmic Toolbox Course on Coursera.
